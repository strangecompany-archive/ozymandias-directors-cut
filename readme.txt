Ozymandias "Director's Cut" readme

Introduction

Well, this isn't exactly a Director's Cut. Rather, it's an alternate version of Ozymandias which we thought we'd release, both because we like this version, artistically speaking, and because it demonstrates some of the flexibility of Machinima. 

Installation
