## About Ozymandias

Praised by Roger Ebert, this adaption of Percy Shelleyâ€™s famous poem was one of the first completely game-independent pieces of Machinima. It was created using _Lithtech Film Producer_, one of the very first dedicated Machinima tools.

The _Director's Cut_ requires the original _Ozymandias_ source code to run, which can be found (here)[https://gitlab.com/strange-company-archive/ozymandias].
